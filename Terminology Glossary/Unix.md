**Definition:**  
Unix is a family of multitasking, multiuser operating systems originally developed in the 1970s at Bell Labs, built around simple tools, text-based interfaces, and a philosophy of combining small programs via pipes.

**Context / Example:**  
- **How/where it’s used:**  
	Unix and Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS, *BSD) form the foundation for many servers, development environments, and security tools. Its design (files, processes, permissions, pipes) heavily influences modern OSes and standards like POSIX.
- **Concrete example:**  
	On a Unix-like system, a user can chain simple commands like `ps aux | grep nginx` to search running processes, or use file permissions (`chmod`, `chown`) to control access to sensitive logs on a server.
