[[OSINT]] encompasses:

1. The Internet (including the deep web)
2. Government and public records
3. Grey literature i.e. technical reports, whitepapers, conference proceedings and metadata in PDFs or Github commit history.
4. Mass media

[[OSINT]] can be used in multiple way

- Malicious actors use OSINT for target profiling, social engineering and doxing.  
- Law enforcement and intelligence use it for counter-terrorism and tracking criminal networks without needing warrants. 
- Businesses use it for competitive analysis and supply chain verification. 
- Journalists use it for fact-checking and geolocation.

## How to Hide Your Location

There are 3 good ways to hide your location:

1. **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** — encrypts traffic and routes it through a remote server. It is fast and easy, but we need to trust the provider’s logging policy to be honest.
    
2. **TOR (The Onion Router)** — routes traffic through multiple random volunteer nodes globally. It provides high anonymity but is slow and often blocked by websites.
    
3. **Public Wi-Fi (Attribution Management)** — can be useful to conduct a high-risk search because even if the IP is traced, it will lead to a public location, making hard to track the search to the searching person.

## Countering Browser Fingerprinting

To hide your location from “Browser fingerprinting” i.e. website recording your screen resolution, installed fonts, battery level to track unique devices even without cookies, there are 3 good countermeasures:

1. User Agent [[Spoofing]]
2. Script Blockers, e.g., uBlock Origin, NoScript
3. Dedicated Research Browser i.e., using a browser that has never logged into your personal accounts (and limits tracking).

## Real-Life OPSEC

It is not enough to practice [[OPSEC]] digitally, you should to practice it in real life as well. Some things you can do are...

1. Avoid Cross-Contamination, i.e. do not log into a personal account inside your investigation VM. One cookie can be enough to link your real identity to your [[Sock puppet]].

2. Do not conduct investigations on your personal devices. They are full of identifying information and metadata.

3. Do not accidentally paste a personal URL or password into a research window. It is likely to reveal your digital footprint.
