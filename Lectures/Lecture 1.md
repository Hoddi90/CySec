## Key Concepts & Takeaways

- [The Attack surface]
	- The sum of all potential vulnerabilities in a system where an attacker could try to subvert then intended purpose of the system and organisation or person who is using it.
	- Email
	- All network point of access
	- USB, CD,Hard drives
	- SMS
	- Software Dist, External Software, Bios, Chips..
	- That essentially refers to any form of input or control over the software or the machine, email, Wifi, Bluetoooth, usb, viruses, malware, SMS, Chips etc.
- [Cyber Defense]
	- Acting in Anticipation to oppose an attack through cyber and cognitive domains. It emphasis pro-activity, not re-activity.
	- Between our information, games, money and infrastructure is an firewall. It protects os from an attacker seeking to read, modify, inject or control anything beyond it. Unfortunately, the firewall has gaps since has to be connected to the internet to communicate with other machines. The primary risk in any secure machine are inadvertent viruses introduced via external sources.
- [Categories of Computer security threat]
	- Unauthorized access
	- Unauthorized modifications
	- Unauthorized disclosure
	- Denial of Authorized access
	- Forgery
	- Repudiation - integrity compromised
	- Spoofing
	
- [Known attacks and viruses]
	- Creeper(1971) was the first computer worm in history and was designed as a test experiment of how a computer program could use self-replication to spread to other computers. It did nothing malicious. It only gave the message “I’M THE CREEPER: CATCH ME IF YOU CAN”.  The first-anti virus software, Reaper (1972) was designed to delete Creeper.
	- Morris Worm(1988) refers to the first computer worm to bring the attention of computer viruses to the public. It had the same purpose as Creeper, to see if it could be done, but was so successful in self-replicating that it consumed excessive system resources, slowing down or crashing systems. IT used brute-force attacks, locking many out of their computer. It exploited weak passwords, buffer overflows and holes in the debug mode of the Unix sendmail program and in the finger network service.
	- Vladimir Levin-10 million in Citibank hack(1994) was an alias for a Russian hacker who stole 10 million USD from citibank in 1994, wiring the amount to various accounts around the world. It is the first time a hacker successfully managed to penetrate the financial system
	- Melissa Email worm(1999) refers to a macro virus/worm that brought down email for various organisations and institutions globally. It used a script, that when a user activated the file, it send itself to the first 50 people in the victim’s Outlook address book. It was successful due to insecure email systems that allowed for automatic opening of attachments, vulnerabilities in the Microsoft Word application to execute macros and lack of user awareness regarding suspicious email attachments.
	- Operation Olympic games(2009) refers to a cyber attack by the USA and Israel against Iran that targeted the Iranian nuclear facility at Natanz. The virus is commonly called Stuxnet. It worked by exploited four zero-day flaws in Microsoft Windows, scanning for Siemens Step7 software (illegal for Iranians to own) and if detected, modified the Iranian centrifugeses rotational speed, which lead to physical destruction at least 1.000 centrifuges, which is estimated setback Iran’s nuclear project by several years.
	- Ukrainian power grid shutdown(2015) refers to a cyber attack by Russia against Ukraine where they used malware via phishing emails to obtain information about 3 Ukrainian energy companies and disrupt the supply of electricity to the consumers of those 3 energy companies.
	- Wannacry Ransomware attack (2017) refers to a ransomware cyber attack by North Korea. It exploited outdated version of Microsoft  Windows via a zero-day vulnerability called EternalBlue, which was known about by the USA’s NSA but hidden from Microsoft due to intended future use for future cyber warfare. The malware checks if there if a kill switch, and if it is not present, it encrypts the computer’s data and tries to spread itself to other computers on the internet and to computers which share the same network as the infected computer.
